   - Requires: pygame + numpy

2. **Lightweight Version** (`keyboard_karaoke_light.py`) 
   - Simplified audio using basic pygame sounds
   - Maximum compatibility without numpy dependency
   - Requires: pygame only

### 🚀 Three Launch Options
1. **Smart Launcher** (`launch_karaoke_smart.sh`) - **RECOMMENDED**
   - Auto-detects available dependencies
   - Launches best possible version
   - "Try full, fallback to light" strategy

2. **Full Launcher** (`launch_karaoke.sh`)
